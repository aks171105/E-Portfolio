                        <p>Participating in the self-introduction exercise was a transformative experience that boosted my confidence and refined my public speaking skills. By speaking in front of my peers, I gradually overcame stage fear and learned to present my experiences and strengths clearly and coherently. This practice not only eased my anxiety about public speaking but also equipped me with a valuable skill for professional interviews, where the ability to articulate one's identity effectively is crucial. Overall, the exercise taught me that clear, confident communication is a key asset in both personal and professional growth.</p>

                        <p>During the second week of the lecture, we tackled a variety of questions that are commonly asked in interviews, such as discussing our strengths and weaknesses, recalling compliments we've received, and answering other fundamental queries. This session was incredibly insightful as it not only challenged us to articulate our personal experiences clearly but also helped us reflect on our attributes and areas for improvement. By practicing these responses, I gained a better understanding of how to present myself effectively in high-pressure situations, making me more prepared and confident for future professional interviews.</p>

                    <h3>Movie Review: The Pursuit of Happyness</h3>
                    <div class="movie-review">
                        <p>The Pursuit of Happyness is a heart-touching and powerful film that follows the true story of Chris Gardner, a struggling salesman who faces immense personal and financial challenges while raising his young son. Set in a tough phase of Gardner's life, the movie highlights the harsh realities of poverty, the sacrifices a parent makes, and the determination it takes to survive and succeed.</p>
                        <p>Will Smith's portrayal of Chris is both raw and inspiring. His chemistry with his real-life son, Jaden Smith, brings an emotional depth that makes the audience feel every high and low. Despite losing his home, his job, and almost his hope, Chris never gives up. His journey from sleeping in shelters to earning a job as a stockbroker is both heartbreaking and motivating.</p>
                        <p>The film's message is clear: success doesn't come easy. It takes patience, effort, and the courage to keep going when everything seems to be falling apart. It's not just a story of success, but of persistence, belief, and the true meaning of happiness.</p>
                        <h4>🌟 Q&A Reflection</h4>
                        <h5>1. Your Favourite Dialogue and Why?</h5>
                        <p>"Don't ever let somebody tell you… you can't do something. Not even me."</p>
                        <p>This line stands out because it represents belief in one's dreams. Chris tells his son that even when others doubt you, including those closest to you, never stop believing in your goals. It's a powerful lesson on self-confidence and staying focused, no matter what others say.</p>
                        <h5>2. Learning to Take Away from the Movie</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Never give up, no matter how tough life gets.</li>
                            <li>Hard work eventually pays off, even if the results take time.</li>
                            <li>Take responsibility for your life, just like Chris did, instead of blaming others.</li>
                            <li>Value your loved ones and never compromise on relationships, even during tough times.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>3. Related Concepts You've Learned in the Classroom</h5>

                            <li>Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs: Chris struggles with basic needs first before reaching his goals and self-fulfillment.</li>
                            <li>Emotional Intelligence: He shows great emotional control and empathy, especially while raising his son under pressure.</li>
                            <li>Decision-Making & Risk Management: Chris makes bold career moves and takes calculated risks with a clear long-term vision.</li>
